The Hierarchy of Incident Response Capabilities is modeled after [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). It describes the capabilities that organizations must build to defend their business assets.

Leaders will have different ways of describing this hierarchy based on their experiences and the needs of their business. This version is based on my experience building incident response capabilities in Office 365, with feedback from the infosec community on Twitter.

You are encouraged to use, modify, and share my description of the incident response hierarchy. It is shared with the community under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

If you have feedback, I would love to hear from you! You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MSwannMSFT) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/swannman).
