# The Hierarchy of Incident Response Capabilities
The Hierarchy of Incident Response Capabilities is modeled after [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs). It describes the capabilities that organizations must build to defend their business assets. Bottom capabilities are prerequisites for successful execution of the capabilities above them.

## What's in here?
A PowerPoint deck with two slides:

1. The hierarchy with a brief explanation of each capability
2. The hierarchy organized into plateaus/phases that organizations may find themselves in

## How can I use it?
You are welcome to use, modify, and share my description of the incident response hierarchy. It is shared with the community under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

## I have feedback!
Leaders will have different ways of describing this hierarchy based on their experiences and the needs of their business. This version is based on my experience building incident response capabilities in Office 365, with feedback from the infosec community on Twitter.

If you have feedback, I would love to hear from you! You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MSwannMSFT) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/swannman).
